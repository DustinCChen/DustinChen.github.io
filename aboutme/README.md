## “调停者” 人格
调停者人格类型的人是真正的理想主义者，他们总是从最坏的人和事中寻找最好的一面，想方设法让情况变得更好。 
虽然可能看起来冷静，内向甚至害羞，但他们内心的火焰和热情可以光芒四射。 
他们仅占人口的 4%，常常被人误解，但当他们找到志同道合的人时，他们之间的和谐就像是快乐和灵感的源泉。

指引“调停者”的是他们的原则，而不是逻辑、头脑发热或是实用性。 当决定如何行动时，他们以荣誉、美好、道德和善良为准则，引导他们行动的是纯粹的意图，而非奖惩。 
调停者人格类型的人以这样的品质为荣，他们也的确应该这样，但不是每个人都能理解这些感情背后的驱动力，这会让他们陷入孤独。

`凡是金子未必都发光， 流浪的人未必都迷茫， 老而弥坚者不会凋零， 深根不会被寒霜触及。`

## 我们知道自己是谁，但不知道自己能成为谁
在好的情况下，这些品质使“调停者”能与他人开展深层次的交流，自如地使用明喻和暗喻，理解和创造象征符号来分享看法。 这种直截了当的交流方式很适合创造型工作，也难怪有很多著名的“调停者”都是诗人、作家和演员。 对“调停者”来说，理解自身和周边环境很有必要，他们把自己投射到作品中，以此表达出这些想法。

`“调停者”非常善于表达自己，擅长使用暗喻和虚构人物来表现自己的美丽和神秘。`

他们高超的语言能力不仅限于母语，他们有学习第二（甚至第三！）语言的天赋。 他们高超的交流能力也与爱好和谐的愿望完美结合，能够帮助他们在找到目标后顺利前行。
## 听很多人说，对很少人讲
与更擅长交际的人格类型不同的是，他们的注意力只集中在很少的人身上，原因只有一个：分散注意太耗费精力，甚至会因为世界上太多无能为力的坏事而感到沮丧。 对于“调停者”的朋友而言，这是一个令人伤感的情景，他们需要“调停者”展示乐观积极的一面。

如果不加注意，“调停者”们可能因为过于用力追求美好而忽视必要的日常琐事。 他们经常陷入沉思，比任何其他人格类型都更享受假设和哲学思考。 如果任其发展，“调停者”也许会减少与人接触，缩回壳中，这可能需要朋友和伴侣非常努力才能把他们拉回现实世界。

幸运的是，“调停者”们的情感，创造力，利他和理想主义仿佛春天的花朵，总会不时地报答他们自己和所爱的人，不是通过逻辑和实用性，而是一种时刻启发着同情，善良和美好的世界观。

Strengths & Weaknesses
## Mediator (INFP) Strengths
* Thoughtful – Mediators care about other people’s feelings. 
They adjust their actions if they think they might hurt anyone, even unintentionally. 
Kindheartedness flows from Mediator personalities, and everyone around them tends to benefit from it.
* Generous – Mediators rarely enjoy succeeding at others’ expense. In general, people with this personality type want to share the good things in their lives. 
They value equality, and they want to ensure that every voice and perspective is heard.
* Open-Minded – Mediators tend to give other people the benefit of the doubt. They aim to be tolerant of other people’s beliefs, 
lifestyles, and decisions. Generally speaking, Mediators support others’ right to live as they see fit – as long as no one is being hurt.
* Creative – Mediators can often see things from unconventional perspectives. 
With their ability to make surprising and unexpected connections, 
it’s no wonder that many Mediators are drawn to creative pursuits and the arts.
* Passionate – When an idea or movement captures Mediators’ imagination and speaks to their beliefs, they can give their whole heart to it. 
People with this personality type can be reserved or reticent, but that doesn’t diminish their strong feelings for a cause that matches their ideals.
* Loyal to Their Values – Doing the right thing isn’t always easy, but Mediators’ far-reaching vision can help them stay the course. 
When they’re doing something meaningful, these personalities can have a sense of purpose or even courage that keeps them true to their values.

## Mediator (INFP) Weaknesses
* Overly Idealistic – Mediators can take their idealism too far. 
People with this personality type might idolize their romantic partner or expect every aspect of their job to feel meaningful. 
This can set them up for disappointment when reality falls short of their dreams.
* Self-Critical – Mediators can expect so much from themselves that they inevitably fall short. When this happens, 
they may accuse themselves of being selfish or woefully inadequate. 
This self-criticism can erode their motivation to get things done and their willingness to prioritize necessary self-care.
* Impractical – When something captures Mediators’ imagination, they can become so consumed by it that they neglect practical matters. 
Some people with this personality type even neglect eating or sleeping as they pursue their passion. 
Other Mediators can become so enamored with an idea that they’re afraid to act on it because they might not do it perfectly.
* Emotionally Driven – Mediators can become so focused on their emotions that they lose track of what’s really going on. 
It can be a challenge for these personalities to slow down and make sure that their feelings aren’t preventing them from clearly seeing the facts of a situation.
* Conflict-Averse – Mediators generally prefer to avoid conflict. They can put a great deal of time and energy into trying to please everyone. 
This desire to please others can drown out their own inner wisdom and make them painfully sensitive to even constructive criticism.
* Difficult to Get to Know – Mediators are private, reserved, and sometimes self-conscious. 
This can make them somewhat difficult to really get to know. 
Their need for personal space can contribute to the guilt they feel for not giving more of themselves to those they care about.
## Romantic Relationships
Mediators (INFPs) are dreamers and idealists, especially when it comes to romance. 
The concept of true love resonates with them, and they’re unlikely to be happy in a relationship that is founded on anything less. 
People with this personality type may find themselves daydreaming about the perfect relationship, 
imagining how it would feel to share their innermost selves with another person.

Most Mediators don’t just want to find a partner – they want to connect with a soul mate. This idealism is among their most endearing traits. 
It’s what enables Mediators to look past superficial appearances and remember what really matters – in love and in life.

That said, Mediator personalities need to make sure that they see their partners as they are – not as they want them to be. 
After all, no partner is perfect, and even the most beautiful of relationships has its challenges. 
With time, many Mediators come to learn that true love doesn’t just magically happen – it takes compromise, understanding, and effort.

## Hopelessly  Devoted
When they meet someone new, most Mediators can’t help but compare that person with the ideal soul mate they’ve imagined in the past. 
Unsurprisingly, this comparison tends to weed out more than a few potential partners. 
Not everyone can match Mediators’ standards for morality and authenticity, and their idealized expectations might not be realistic. 
As a result, single Mediators may sometimes worry that they’ll never find anyone who is a match for them.

When they do find a kindred spirit, Mediators show themselves to be passionate, hopeless romantics. 
At the same time, they still respect their partner’s independence. 
Mediator personalities use their compassion and insight to understand the people they care about, 
and they use their creativity to make their partner feel special.

`ediators share a sincere belief that two people can come together in a relationship and make each other better and happier than they were before.`

Most Mediators aim to accept their partners as they are. That said, these personalities also want to help their partners learn, grow, and pursue their goals. 
Mediators are always dreaming up ways to improve themselves and the world around them. The last thing they’d want is for their partners to feel unhappy or stuck.

As a result, many people with this personality type dedicate themselves to helping their partners improve their lives. 
Although this is a noble goal, Mediators may need to be careful not to lose sight of their own needs and priorities. 
They might also need to make sure that their partners are really ready to change. 
As long as they do so, Mediators’ support and devotion can make all the difference in their partners’ lives.

## Finding What’s Real
Mediators tend to avoid conflict whenever possible. This can help make their relationships stable, 
but it can also compromise the authenticity of their connection with their partners. 
These personalities may try to make their partners happy at all costs, sacrificing their own needs and preferences.

Mediators can also have a tendency to mentally fixate on problems in their relationships rather than discuss them openly. 
Because they don’t want to trigger a conflict, they may find it difficult to talk about what’s wrong and why. 
This can cause significant issues in their relationships. After all, their partners can’t read their minds.

People with this personality type may need to remind themselves that open, honest communication is necessary in a relationship, 
even if it isn’t always easy. These moments of candor can transform a relationship for the better.

As long as they communicate openly, Mediators are more than capable of staying true to themselves in a relationship – 
and encouraging the person they love to do the same. By bringing their whole hearts and minds to their relationships, 
Mediators can find out what it truly means to love and be loved.

## Career Paths
Many Mediators (INFPs) long for a career that doesn’t just take care of the bills but also feels fulfilling. 
They want to spend their days doing something they genuinely love, preferably without too much stress or drama. 
For these personalities, an ideal professional life should feel like a calling, not just a job.

At times, idealistic Mediators might struggle to find a profession that meets their practical needs and fulfills their dreams. 
They may drift in frustration, waiting for the perfect job to present itself and eventually feeling stuck or worried that they’re not living up to their potential. 
Alas, there’s no such thing as a perfect job. The question of whether to settle for a less-than-ideal position can weigh heavily on people with this personality type.

Fortunately, Mediators stand out for their creativity, independence, and sincere desire to connect with and help others. 
These traits can help them shine – and find fulfillment – in nearly any line of work.

## There’s a Place for Everyone
Mediators can succeed nearly anywhere, but certain fields seem to be especially attractive to these personalities. 
With their curiosity and their love of self-expression, many Mediators dream of becoming writers. 
They might write novels, seek out interesting freelance niches, or even find themselves doing communications in a corporate field or for a nonprofit organization. 
Richly imaginative, Mediators can infuse even the driest of fundraising or marketing materials with new life.

`Nearly any field can benefit from Mediators’ artful communication style. As a result, Mediators may have their pick of jobs 
when choosing whether to work in the nonprofit or for-profit sphere – or for themselves.`

Although these personalities aren’t known for seeking the spotlight, they may find their life’s purpose in the performing arts. 
Mediators are sensitive to artistic beauty, and some of them simply come to life in the worlds of music, drama, or dance. 
These Mediators can draw from their inner depths to pull out exquisite interpretations of a creator’s work. 
Many Mediators also create their own works as playwrights, composers, and choreographers.

Whatever they do, people with this personality type want to feel that their work is helping others. 
As a result, some Mediators find it gratifying to work with clients face-to-face.
Service careers, such as massage therapy, physical rehabilitation, counseling, social work, psychology, 
and even teaching can be exceptionally rewarding for Mediators, who take pride in the progress and growth that they help foster.

People with this personality type tend to put others’ interests ahead of their own. This is a mixed blessing, 
as it can make it hard for them to establish a healthy work-life balance. 
That said, few things are more rewarding for Mediators than seeing their work help change someone’s life for the better.

## Finding Their Way
Mediators may find it demotivating to work in high-stress, bureaucratic, or hectic environments. 
They may also become frustrated by workplaces that are highly critical or competitive. 
Workplaces that reward independence tend to be a good fit for Mediators, 
although they may appreciate some structure and oversight to help them avoid procrastination and getting lost in thought.

That said, Mediators don’t need ideal conditions to thrive professionally. These personalities want to live in tune with their values, 
in their careers as much as in any other aspect of their lives. As long as they feel a strong sense of mission in their work, 
they can put up with – and overcome – any number of challenges.
## Conclusion
Few personality types are as poetic and kindhearted as Mediators (INFPs). 
Their altruism and vivid imagination allow them to overcome many challenging obstacles – and more often than not, 
they brighten the lives of those around them in the process. Mediators’ creativity is invaluable in many areas, including their own personal growth.

Yet Mediators can be tripped up in areas where idealism and altruism are more of a liability than an asset. 
When it comes to finding (or keeping) a partner, making friends, pursuing a meaningful career, 
or planning for the future, people with this personality type may need to consciously develop their weaker traits and gain new skills.
