# 人格类型 INFP-T
## “调停者” 人格
调停者人格类型的人是真正的理想主义者，他们总是从最坏的人和事中寻找最好的一面，想方设法让情况变得更好。 
虽然可能看起来冷静，内向甚至害羞，但他们内心的火焰和热情可以光芒四射。 
他们仅占人口的 4%，常常被人误解，但当他们找到志同道合的人时，他们之间的和谐就像是快乐和灵感的源泉。

指引“调停者”的是他们的原则，而不是逻辑、头脑发热或是实用性。 当决定如何行动时，他们以荣誉、美好、道德和善良为准则，引导他们行动的是纯粹的意图，而非奖惩。 
调停者人格类型的人以这样的品质为荣，他们也的确应该这样，但不是每个人都能理解这些感情背后的驱动力，这会让他们陷入孤独。

`凡是金子未必都发光， 流浪的人未必都迷茫， 老而弥坚者不会凋零， 深根不会被寒霜触及。`

## 我们知道自己是谁，但不知道自己能成为谁
在好的情况下，这些品质使“调停者”能与他人开展深层次的交流，自如地使用明喻和暗喻，理解和创造象征符号来分享看法。 这种直截了当的交流方式很适合创造型工作，也难怪有很多著名的“调停者”都是诗人、作家和演员。 对“调停者”来说，理解自身和周边环境很有必要，他们把自己投射到作品中，以此表达出这些想法。

`“调停者”非常善于表达自己，擅长使用暗喻和虚构人物来表现自己的美丽和神秘。`

他们高超的语言能力不仅限于母语，他们有学习第二（甚至第三！）语言的天赋。 他们高超的交流能力也与爱好和谐的愿望完美结合，能够帮助他们在找到目标后顺利前行。
## 听很多人说，对很少人讲
与更擅长交际的人格类型不同的是，他们的注意力只集中在很少的人身上，原因只有一个：分散注意太耗费精力，甚至会因为世界上太多无能为力的坏事而感到沮丧。 对于“调停者”的朋友而言，这是一个令人伤感的情景，他们需要“调停者”展示乐观积极的一面。

如果不加注意，“调停者”们可能因为过于用力追求美好而忽视必要的日常琐事。 他们经常陷入沉思，比任何其他人格类型都更享受假设和哲学思考。 如果任其发展，“调停者”也许会减少与人接触，缩回壳中，这可能需要朋友和伴侣非常努力才能把他们拉回现实世界。

幸运的是，“调停者”们的情感，创造力，利他和理想主义仿佛春天的花朵，总会不时地报答他们自己和所爱的人，不是通过逻辑和实用性，而是一种时刻启发着同情，善良和美好的世界观。

When they’re doing something meaningful, these personalities can have a sense of purpose or even courage that keeps them true to their values.

## Mediator (INFP) Weaknesses
* Overly Idealistic – Mediators can take their idealism too far. 
People with this personality type might idolize their romantic partner or expect every aspect of their job to feel meaningful. 
This can set them up for disappointment when reality falls short of their dreams.
* Self-Critical – Mediators can expect so much from themselves that they inevitably fall short. When this happens, 
they may accuse themselves of being selfish or woefully inadequate. 
This self-criticism can erode their motivation to get things done and their willingness to prioritize necessary self-care.
* Impractical – When something captures Mediators’ imagination, they can become so consumed by it that they neglect practical matters. 
Some people with this personality type even neglect eating or sleeping as they pursue their passion. 
Other Mediators can become so enamored with an idea that they’re afraid to act on it because they might not do it perfectly.
* Emotionally Driven – Mediators can become so focused on their emotions that they lose track of what’s really going on. 
It can be a challenge for these personalities to slow down and make sure that their feelings aren’t preventing them from clearly seeing the facts of a situation.
* Conflict-Averse – Mediators generally prefer to avoid conflict. They can put a great deal of time and energy into trying to please everyone. 
This desire to please others can drown out their own inner wisdom and make them painfully sensitive to even constructive criticism.
* Difficult to Get to Know – Mediators are private, reserved, and sometimes self-conscious. 
This can make them somewhat difficult to really get to know. 
Their need for personal space can contribute to the guilt they feel for not giving more of themselves to those they care about.
